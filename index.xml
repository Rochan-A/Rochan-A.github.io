      <description>Rochan Avlur Venkat 1 I am not sure how many of you have heard about the recently released television series created by Laeta Kalogridis that premiered on Netflix on February 2, 2018. The critical reviews that it received during its short ten-episode season made it one of the most actively debated and discussed in hundreds of communities on the Internet.

      <description>Fun fact, most people can&amp;rsquo;t pronounce my first name. It&amp;rsquo;s roh-chan, not raw-chan or roh-shan. I&amp;rsquo;m a 19 year old, read a lot on various (sometimes random) topics, knew what I wanted to do at the age of 13, I can&amp;rsquo;t sleep after 7am and play almost every sport. I spent the first 17 years of my life in Bangalore, India. It&amp;rsquo;s only recently that I spend majority of the year in Hyderabad, India where I am studying undergraduate Computer Science at Mahindra Ecole Centrale.</description>

      <description>The birth of a (umm&amp;hellip;) Hi.
So lets see how this goes. Not sure how often I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to update this but it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try and do.
I&amp;rsquo;ll probably just be updating it with stuff that I find interesting, come across or just put stuff up that&amp;rsquo;s on my mind.
Hey, there&amp;rsquo;s always a first time right.
So, see ya soon.
